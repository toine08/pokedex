# Pokedex

This is a project in golang from the course on [boot.dev](boot.dev)

As I did for the http-server course I will do the same and write everything I do, what I have to do, and my code and some notes about how I feel and things like that.
You can check the [http-server](https://github.com/toine08/http-server) to see an example.
